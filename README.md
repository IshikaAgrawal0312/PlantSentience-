# PlantSentience

## Project Description

PlantSentience is an innovative blockchain-based plant monitoring system that bridges the gap between traditional gardening and modern IoT technology. This smart contract system allows plant owners to register their plants, track real-time health metrics through IoT sensors, and receive intelligent alerts about their plants' wellbeing.

The system leverages Ethereum blockchain technology to create an immutable, transparent record of plant health data, enabling gardeners, researchers, and agricultural professionals to make data-driven decisions about plant care and optimize growing conditions.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a decentralized ecosystem where:
- **Every plant has a digital identity** - Plants are registered on the blockchain with unique IDs and ownership records
- **Health data is transparent and immutable** - All sensor readings are permanently stored and verifiable
- **Intelligent plant care becomes accessible** - Automated alerts and analytics help both novice and expert gardeners
- **Plant ownership can be transferred** - Digital plant assets can be traded or gifted while preserving their entire health history
- **Community-driven plant knowledge** emerges from aggregated, anonymous health data

We envision a future where blockchain technology enables smarter agriculture, better plant conservation, and more successful gardening through data-driven insights.
